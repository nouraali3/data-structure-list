# data-structure-list

created a class node 
created a class list that is friend to node
created a main to test the fuctionalities of the two classes


Note: classes node and list need some updates in 
(1)creating get and set to access and return node data and next ptr
(2)creating more functions in class list like i- indexof(certain data)
                                              ii-getdata(certain index)
